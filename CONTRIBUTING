Coding Style
------------

  - Use 4 spaces instead of tabs.
  - Do not add any trailing spaces at the end of a line.
  - Variable and function names are in studlyCaps.
  - Functions should have any modifiers and the return type on one line and the
    function name and parameters on another.
  - The opening braces for functions should be on a new line.
  - The opening braces for ifs, fors, and whiles inside a function should be on
    the same line.
  - All comments should be started with /** and ended with **/
  - All functions and classes should have javadoc comments.

An example for clarity is shown below.

    public Foo
    Bar(Foo fooExample)
    {
	Foo fooReturn = new Foo();
        /** Do some function stuff here **/
	return fooReturn;
    }
